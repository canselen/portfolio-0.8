                <p>Greetings this is Faik Sinan Canselen and this is my CV : <br>
                    <br>
                        My educational career as fallows; <br>
                        I graduated from American Collage Institution in Turkey with Degree of literature and maths. <br>

                        <br>
                        At the 4th and last year of University I froze my Account to enrol in Coder Academy Boot Camp to become some where close to being an Junior Developer and to fallow my passion of becoming IT personal. And I am on a road to become one . <br>
                        <br>
                        My business career as fallows; <br>
                        While in university I worked at my parents company Matdigital for 3 years. <br>
                        I did as fallows accountant assistant, marketing management assistant, IT personal and assistant and as production manager. <br>
                        <br>
                        At meantime I worked in mental care and services company called Mind and More as metal adviser for people who struggle with certain difficulties, I mostly specialised on Dyslexia. I also worked on charity project there which focus on mental care and progressive learning of government middle schools. <br>
                        <br>
                        My sports career as fallows; <br>
                        I played professional basketball from early age of 6 till I turned 15, the last 2 teams which I played in was top 5 of Turkish League. At BJK team and collage team I played in finals of Turkish League and at BJK we became the Champions of twice in row. <br>
                        In collage I dropped play basketball as I explored wind surfing and fell in love with. <br>
                        I have been competing at wind surf races both globally and locally for over 5 years now.  I have been in the top 10 in Turkish League for over 4 years now. <br>
                        As my other hobby I was the captain of cross team of ACI for 3 years and run in any race that was below 5 km. <br>
